🧠 MoEA: Multi-Model Synthesis Agent (v2.0)
MoEA is a customizable multi-layer, multi-model AI reasoning pipeline built for OpenWebUI. It enhances answer quality by:

🔁 1. Parallel Prompting (Expert Layering)
Routes a single user prompt to multiple selected models (e.g., LLaMA3, Mistral, Gemma).

Each model acts as an “expert” providing its own response.

🧬 2. Layered Thinking
Supports multi-layer querying. Each layer refines or reflects on the responses from the prior layer (like agents debating and improving their reasoning).

🧩 3. Final Synthesis
All responses are merged into a structured, comprehensive answer by a selected synthesis model.

The user receives a clean response — not a chain of fragments — with the option to debug or display expert thoughts if enabled.

⚙️ Configurable Valves:
MODELS: Choose which LLMs are involved

NUM_LAYERS: Choose 1 or more layers

TEMPERATURE, TOP_K, TOP_P: Fine-tune sampling behavior

SHOW_AGENT_THOUGHTS: Option to expose expert reasoning in the final output

🧩 Plug-and-Play:
Drop-in JSON for OpenWebUI’s function tool.

No external services or internet required when using local models.

🔍 Use Cases
Complex question answering

Red-teaming or model comparison

Research synthesis

Local AI agent scaffolding

This architecture supports error tolerance, retries, and streaming or non-streaming outputs depending on the mode and model backend.
